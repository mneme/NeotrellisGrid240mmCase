Just another take on a 3d printed case for a Neotrellis Grid.

I like heat set insets, I like screws and my print-bed is only 250mm wide hence. Well. This.

Glue the USB-C break out bord down like your life depended on it.

# Stuff
* Insets: [Brass Heat-Set Inserts for Plastic - M3 x 4mm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4255)
* USB-C Breakout: [Sparkfun BOB-15100](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15100)
* Screws: not a clue. They came in a box. Eh. M3? You probably want to tweak the screw head holes if you don't have the same ones just laying around. Tweak the scad file if it helps. It's messy but at least the variables are easy to find.
