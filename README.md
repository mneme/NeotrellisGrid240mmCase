Just another take on a 3d printed case for a Neotrellis Grid.

I like heat set insets, I like screws and my print-bed is only 240mm wide hence. Well. This.

Glue the USB-C break out bord down like your life depended on it.

Screws - not a clue. They came in a box. Eh. M3? You probably want to teak the screw head hole if you don't have the same ones just laying around.
